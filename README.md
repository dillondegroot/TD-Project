## Tanky's Tower Defense

### About game:
We made this game for a school project, it was fun to work on yet sometimes challenging to work in a team because of planning.

It's a small tower defense game with randomized terrain, various enemies and creative towers.

We came up with the idea because of other first person TD games and thought randomized terrain would be interesting.

### Controls:
Walk - W, A, S, D

Towers - 1, 2, 3, 4

Place - Left Mouse

Destroy - Right Mouse

### Towers:
1 - Grey peashooter ($30)

2 - Minigun ($50)

3 - Slow Tower ($50)

4 - Poison Tower ($100)

### Enemies:
1 - Standard enemy (red)

2 - Yellow annoying cube

3 - Tanky (blue with tophat)

4 - Miniboss (Minecraft villager noises)

5 - Boss (the inner thoughts of my partner)
